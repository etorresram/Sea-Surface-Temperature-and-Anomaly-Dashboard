# Peru Sea Surface Temperature and Anomaly Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a dynamic dashboard developed using Dash and Plotly in Python. It is designed to visualize and analyze the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and its anomalies (SSTA) across various cities in Peru. The data is displayed interactively, allowing users to toggle between SST and SSTA for detailed insights.

## Features

Interactive Graphs: Users can select either 'Sea Surface Temperature' or 'Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly' to view corresponding data visualizations.
City-wise Analysis: The dashboard provides a comparative view of the temperature data across different cities.
User-friendly Interface: The dashboard is built with usability in mind, ensuring that it is easy for users of all levels to navigate and interact with the data.

## Data Source

The data used in this dashboard includes daily measurements of sea surface temperatures and their anomalies from various coastal cities in Peru. Each city's data is stored in a .txt file, with readings collected over recent years from Instituto del Mar Peru - IMARPE https://www.imarpe.gob.pe/imarpe/index2.php?id_seccion=I0178030103000000000000
